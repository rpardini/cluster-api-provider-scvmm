ScvmmMachineReconciler: 

-> Reconcile

  - Get ScvmmMachine
  - Get Owner Machine (ownerref on ScvmmMachine, use util)
  - Get Cluster       (metadata on Machine, use util)
  - Get ScvmmCluster  (spec on Cluster)
  - patchHelper on ScvmmMachine
   - defer patchHelper update (so it always updates)
  - Add Finalizer     (controllerutil)
  - Waitretry on cluster status InfrastructureReady
  - Being deleted, then do ReconcileDelete
  - Else do ReconcileNormal

-> ReconcileNormal

  - If ProviderID set it's done so finish.  We should check status, but maybe better in a timer loop that batch-checks?
  - Check DataSecretName on Machine, 
   - If not there finish, but check if we're not controlplane and controlplane is not initialized (for better status I guess?)
  - Create the Scvmm VM (if it doesn't exist already)
   - Set condition to show it's being created, and if finished that it's created
   - Get bootstrapdata from DataSecretName
   - Get an IP address for the hostname from the spec (custom script, company-specific)
   - Add bootstrapdata as ISO image, combined with IP address, hostname, and dns stuff
   - Additional data from spec, I guess?
  - Turn on if it's not on
   - Again, set condition
  - Get host data and set it in the status field
  - Set providerID and set status to ready (including condition)

-> ReconcileDelete

  - Shutdown VM
   - Set status to turning off first
  - Remove VM
   - Set status to removing first
  - Remove the finalizer

ScvmmClusterReconciler:

-> Reconcile

  - Get ScvmmCluster
  - Get Owner Cluster
  - patchHelper on ScvmmCluster
   - defer patchHelper update (so it always updates)
  - Do something with failure domains
  - Add Finalizer
  - Being deleted, then do ReconcileDelete
  - Else do ReconcileNormal

-> ReconcileNormal

  - Do something with API endpoint IP (just one of the machines?  VPI/keepalive?  MetalLB? Does capi support a list of endpoints?)
  - Maybe stick some bootstrap data in the cluster (data that describes the cluster, name etc etc?  Dunno.)
  - Perhaps install some kind of networking (canal, calico, ...)
  - Do we need ingress VIP or MetalLB stuff?  Dunno

-> ReconcoleDelete

  - Maybe do something to release api IPs ?
  - Remove the finalizer
