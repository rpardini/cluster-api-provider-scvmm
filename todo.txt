BBugs:
v Fails when reconciling delete: It doesn't work when the cluster is not there etc etc
v Errors out when trying to get bootstrapdata if it's not there
v Doesn't seem to update the status when erroring out (!!)
v CreateVM takes too long and hits a winrm timeout
    (could return a lot sooner, then we don't get the VM info, but that should come next reconcile)

Todo:
- Actually send the bootstrap data (mount as iso image)  <- This is the big one
- Set a template (needs a field in the spec)
- What should the cluster reconciler do?  Maybe generate a kAPI vip or something?


Uploading an ISO:
- Create iso (using go library and then compres and send as base64, or using the powershell script?)
- Get-SCLibrarySHare -Name <???> (probably env var to determine which?)
- Upload iso to library share (libraryshare.Path \ISOs) (also env var?)
- Read-SCLibraryShare -LibraryShare <libraryshare> -Path <...\ISOs> (Re-scans the library)
- Get-SCISO -Name <uploaded file>
- New-SCVirtualDVDDrive with iso
